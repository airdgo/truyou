# TruYou

## Concept

TruYou is a social media web application where users can register and post once each day. Each time they post, users are required to select their emotional state from the list of happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, and disgusted. They must explain why they are in that mood, and, if desired, upload a photo. After a week, a visual displaying of the user's emotions will show up. If they're open to sharing, the user can also meet new people and see how they're feeling.
